Well here we are.

I guess my entrypoint is to fresh up on some SPI documentation/basics. I already found a pretty good basic wikipedia article. Link below.
I remember reading somewhere that there is a huge list of documented and known GPIO pins and what they do. I'll try to find that as it
may be useful for obvious reasons. 

I'd assume that the SPI interface, specifically MOSI and MISO lines of the interface, use something similar to I2C where bits are sent one
at a time, eventually sending the whole bit by a shift register.

By reversing some code, it seems that the SPI driver implemented by iBoot is using a one-byte shift register. It also seems like the SPI
supports DMAs from the slaves?

There's some hints that the SPI has something to do with IRQs. Not sure if this means it's IRQ driven.

Some interesting startup functions to look at that may interest us that need to be reverse:

platform_init_setup_clocks()
platform_init_hwpins()
platform_early_init()
platform_init()
